android-location-tracker
========================

Android Simple Location Tracker is an Android library that helps you get user location with a object named `LocationTracker`

### Installation

Add this to your `build.gradle` file

```gradle
repositories {
    maven {
        url "https://jitpack.io"
    }
}

dependencies {
        compile 'com.github.quentin7b:android-location-tracker:4.0'
}
```

Don't forget to add the following permissions to your *AndroidManifest.xml*

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION" />
```

Be aware of `Android Marshmallow`'s new [permission system](https://developer.android.com/preview/features/runtime-permissions.html)

```xml
<permission-group
	android:name="android.permission-group.LOCATION"
	android:label="A label for your permission"
	android:description="A description for the permission" />
```


### Use

As its name says, it's a *simple* library.
To create a tracker you just need to add the below code in your Android Activity / Service / WorkManager

> Be aware, you'll have to manage runtime permissions on Manifest.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION & Manifest.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION

#### Create the tracker

Constructor is defined as this
```kotlin
LocationTracker(
    val timeBetweenUpdates: Long = 5 * 60 * 1000.toLong(),
    val metersBetweenUpdates: Float = 100f,
    val shouldUseGPS: Boolean = true,
    val shouldUseNetwork: Boolean = true,
    val shouldUsePassive: Boolean = true
)
```

And it's done, as soon as a location has been found, it will call the `onLocationFound()` method and you can do the job.

### Provide custom use

You can call a `LocationTracker` with custom parameters.
To do this, use the following constructor

```java
LocationTracker(Context context, TrackerSettings settings)
```

As an example:
```java
LocationTracker tracker = new LocationTracker(
	context,
	new TrackerSettings()
    		.setUseGPS(true)
    		.setUseNetwork(false)
    		.setUsePassive(false)
    	) {

	@Override
	public void onLocationFound(Location location) {
		// Do some stuff when a new GPS Location has been found
	}
};
tracker.startListening()
```

This, will call a location tracker that is looking *ONLY* for *GPS* updates.
*Network* and *Passive* updates will not be catched by the Tracker.

### Providers AND metrics custom use

`LocationTracker` allows you to define some custom metrics like
<ul>
<li> The minimum time interval between location updates, in milliseconds </li>
<li> The minimum distance between location updates, in meters </li>
</ul>

To specify those parameters, `LocationTracker` you can set more settings.
Here is an example of call:
```java
TrackerSettings settings =
        new TrackerSettings()
            .setUseGPS(true)
            .setUseNetwork(true)
            .setUsePassive(true)
            .setTimeBetweenUpdates(30 * 60 * 1000)
            .setMetersBetweenUpdates(100);	     

LocationTracker tracker = new LocationTracker(context, settings) {

	@Override
	public void onLocationFound(Location location) {
		// Do some stuff when a new location has been found.
	}
};
tracker.startListening();
```

In this case, when a location is found, the tracker will not call `onLocationFound()` again during *30 minutes*.
Moreover, if the distance between the new location and the older one is less than 100m, `onLocationFound()` will not be called.

Be aware that the *time* parameter's priority is higher than the *distance* parameter. So even if the user has moved from 2km, the `tracker` will call `onLocationFound()` only after *30 minutes*.

### Manage the tracker

By default, after a `LocationTracker` is created, it automatically starts listening to updates... and never stops.
`LocationTracker` has two methods to *start* and *stop* listening for updates.

If you want to *stop* listening for updates, just call the `stopListening()` method.
For example, if you need a *one shot* position, you can do that:

```java
LocationTracker tracker = new LocationTracker(context) {

	@Override
	public void onLocationFound(Location location) {
		// Stop listening for updates
		stopListening()
		// Do some stuff when a new GPS Location has been found
	}
};
tracker.startListening();
```

You can also do it in the `onPause()` Activity method if you want.

```java
@Override
protected void onPause() {
	if(myTracker != null) {
		myTracker.stopListening();
	}
	super.onPause();
}
```

REMEMBER! A `LocationTracker` never stops untill you tell it to do so.

You may want to start listening for updates after all. To do that, `LocationTracker` has a public method named `startListening()`, call it when you want.

For example, in the `onResume()` Activity method:
```java
@Override
protected void onResume() {
	if(myTracker != null) {
		myTracker.startListening();
	}
	super.onResume();
}
```
### Overriding

`LocationTracker` implements Android's [LocationListener](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/LocationListener.html) interface.

By default, it does nothing but logging.

Excepts the `onLocationChanged()` method, you can override all the [LocationListener](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/LocationListener.html)'s metods, so here is the list:
<ul>
<li>onProviderDisabled(String provider)</li>
<li>onProviderEnabled(String provider)</li>
<li>onStatusChanged(String provider, int status, Bundle extras)</li>
</ul>
